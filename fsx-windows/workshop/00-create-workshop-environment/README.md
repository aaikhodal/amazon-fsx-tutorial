### Prerequisites

* An AWS account with administrative level access
* An Amazon EC2 key pair

If a key pair has not been previously created in your account, please refer to [Creating a Key Pair Using Amazon EC2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) from the AWS EC2 User's Guide.  

Verify that the key pair is created in the same AWS region you will use for the tutorial.

WARNING!! This workshop environment will exceed your free-usage tier. You will incur charges as a result of building this environment and executing the scripts included in this workshop. Delete all AWS resources created during this workshop so you donâ€™t continue to incur additional compute and storage charges.

IMPORTANT!! Before selecting "Create stack" at the end of the AWS CloudFormation create stack wizard, make sure you check both boxes in the "Capabilities" section. If not, the stack will fail at the very end (20-35 minutes) and you'll have to start over.
